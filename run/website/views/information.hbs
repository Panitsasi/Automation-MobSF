                        &nbsp; Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. MobSF support mobile app binaries (APK, IPA ,APPX) along with zipped source code and provides REST APIs for seamless integration with your CI/CD or DevSecOps pipeline.The Dynamic Analyzer helps you to perform runtime security assesment and interactive instrumented testing.

                    <h5 class="hash-function">MD5</h5>
                    <p class="hash-function-info"> &nbsp; The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database.
                        MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. </p>
                    <h5 class="hash-function" >SHA1</h5>
                    <p class="hash-function-info"> &nbsp; In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input    and     produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest – typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.

                        Since 2005, SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents; as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement.NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 and disallowed its use for digital signatures in 2013. As of 2020, chosen-prefix attacks against SHA-1 are practical. As such, it is recommended to remove SHA-1 from products as soon as possible and instead use SHA-2 or SHA-3. Replacing SHA-1 is urgent where it is used for digital signatures.

                        All major web browser vendors ceased acceptance of SHA-1 SSL certificates in 2017.In February 2017, CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a collision attack against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash.But SHA-1 is still secure for HMAC. </p>
                    <h5 class="hash-function">SHA2</h5>
                    <p class="hash-function-info">&nbsp; SHA2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001.They are built using the Merkle–Damgård structure, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a specialized block cipher.
                        SHA-2 includes significant changes from its predecessor, SHA-1. The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values. SHA-512/224 and S</p>
                        
                    <h5 class="app-security">SDK</h5>
                     <p class="app-security-info">A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They facilitate the creation of applications by having compiler, debugger and perhaps a software framework. They are normally specific to a hardware platform and operating system combination.To create applications with advanced functionalities such as advertisements, push notifications, etc; most application software developers use specific software development kits.  </p>


                     <h5 class="app-security">Application Permissions</h5>
                     <p class="app-security-info">Permissions are a means of controlling and regulating access to specific system- and device-level functions by software. Typically, types of permissions cover functions that may have privacy implications, such as the ability to access a device's hardware features (including the camera and microphone), and personal data (such as device storage, the contacts list, and the user's present geographical location). Permissions are typically declared in an application's manifest, and certain permissions must be specifically granted at runtime by the user—who may revoke the permission at any time.
                        Permission systems are common on mobile operating systems, where permissions needed by specific apps must be disclosed via the platform's app store. </p>

                     <h5 class="app-security">App Security Score</h5>
                     <p class="app-security-info">With this data we can calculate the risk we take when we execute the apk file. In MobSF the specific property is classified in 4 cases CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM and LOW.The vulnerability that can occur from the executable of the file is reduced accordingly.</p>

                     <p class="cvss-info">The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities. CVSS attempts to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing responders to prioritize responses and resources according to threat. Scores are calculated based on a formula that depends on several metrics that approximate ease of exploit and the impact of exploit. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most severe. While many utilize only the CVSS Base score for determining severity, temporal and environmental scores also exist, to factor in availability of mitigations and how widespread vulnerable systems are within an organization, respectively. </p>
